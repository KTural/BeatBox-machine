Simple Gui, Sound used BeatBox machine 
Firstly You can send your press checkboxes whatever sound pattern you want, each pattern horizontally represent specific key that makes its own particular sound. It enables to press start and stop buttons to see your patterns whether they work for you or not, so you can change it into your own choice of patterns. You are able to set Tempo up and down which affect mostly velocity of playing patterns. You can serialize(save) your pattern so later on you might want to just load it back(deserialize) to your current pattern surface. You can reset all your checked patterns to the null checked patterns, so it gives you a chance to get restarted. Lastly, you can send your patterns to the server as a message, and other clients might see your pattern, afterwards by pressing the message they can automatically hear your pattern by being copied into their own pattern service just like you have it on your frame.
